# Ladder Logic Editor

Vision Statement:
An editor that seamlesslessly allows the exploration, learning and sharing of the mystique and glory of Structured Text and Ladder Diagrams, with integrated scenarios, and extensible hardware configurations to play with and learn.

What to expect:
As a user, you can wire up hardware like traffic lights, like pumps, safety critical control systems and both visualise and simulate their operation in a graphical user interface, on any browser. 
Save your configurations, edit the Structured Text, in our own dialect of strutured text. Create real systems, including definiting the visualisations of traffic light components, wire them and connect states to real actions. See the outputs in realtime or accelerated time.

This is a great to use, intuitive, guided experience to teach you the fundamentals.
