Choose the most imporant feature to begin work on

Important:
You are adding tests, and implementing the test plan to formally validate that all features of the interpreter
Ensure progress is made on the tests, and tests are written appropriately
Choose property based tests, or unit tests as appropriate
Ensure we commit and push changes after each iteration.
Given you're in a loop, make a logical amount of progress. Only report RALPH_DONE when all tasks are done. Do not assume things are done, validate and check it.
You are not done if there are skipped tests.
